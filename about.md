![James Wigger](/images/me.jpg)

Currently working as a Web Developer at [Root Studio](http://rootstudio.co.uk) in Lincoln UK, I have a strong drive to create beautifully designed, well functioning and fast-loading web projects.

During the other 16 hours of the day I enjoy cooking, gardening, photography and taking long walks in the countryside.

I'm always happy to chat and you can reach me through my [email address](mailto:james.s.wigger@gmail.com) or [@jamesyps](http://twitter.com/jamesyps) on twitter.
