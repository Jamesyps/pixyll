**I don't have many traditions, eschewing them more for moving forward with my life unwilling to get trapped in repeating patterns of behaviour for reasons that are soon forgotten. There is one, however I will stick to - and that's having a thoughtful and considered review of my year. A personal appraisal in how I'm doing as a human being.**

2014 has been the year of the deep breath. Throughout I have had to dive deep into deep unknowns, carried on currents of uncertainty and a whole lot of *just-fucking-do-it*. There have been many great changes, and many bad ones. People have left, changed, and those who previously disappointed me have shined way more than when 2013 drew to a close.

### The Early Months
January started with a new purpose. Just a few weeks earlier I had been offered the full time position in a little (but growing) studio in Lincoln, my student-adopted city. This put in that oh so rare position of a student who would end their degree with instant employment. 

The caveat though was my immediate panic that with my student tenancy being finite in nature (this was my final year after all) that I would need to get somewhere to live. The other issue being my girlfriend's then lack of employment and whether or not to offer a free-ride so-to-speak in sharing a tenancy or searching alone. Looking back, the last option was never going to happen but at the risk of sounding cruel, you have to be objective in these matters - if you can't afford both of you, everyone loses.

We began looking on Rightmove for places to rent, and worryingly we found many places that were perfectly affordable on my soon-to-be salary. It couldn't be that simple could it? Well, no. 

The dive into the world of estate agents and rental agreements was a steep learning curve that over a decade of compulsory education and five years of additional studies through sixth form and university had done little to soften. Emails were soon ruled out as too modern for most agencies who at best simply subscribed you to newsletters (that still plague my inbox). Replacing that came the tedious task of researching online, visiting their offices and requesting a viewing.

More often than not whatever archaic system they use to manage properties online did not reflect the current state which is usually snapped up. The savagery of the student housing fair had grown to almost a county sized frenzy for even poorly maintained houses.

Eventually we broke through this ceiling to the next level of viewings. Having always been told to have multiple viewings and consider carefully, we viewed two properties. One, a modern flat was very far outside of any social circles and felt oppressively quiet. The other, a quaint terrace with sticky doors felt far more homely. Both, of course were soon gone - but not before we were strung along with talks of 'one other application' and a phone interview with the prospective landlord.

Another exciting development in time-wasting came from a successful viewing of a brand new build, triple glazed, gated perfectly decent house only to be told 'no students'. Despite pointing out our time as students was at most two further months while there was a good 60 years or so as not one this did not prove successful. The kicker being we had explained our position from the start.

It felt like not only were the days getting longer due to the increasing daylight, but due to constantly walking from one side of Lincoln to the other for no gain. That is until we tried the agency down the end of our road on a whim and nabbed a delightful, though flawed, house in an area quite above a 21 year old still-student part-time web developer.

Oh yes, roll on summer.

### Exhale, slightly.
At some point holding your breath you've got to breath out. Even if it's just a little. This is the brief, wonderful period once moved in where not only was everything new - but novel. The honeymoon period of paying council tax. We're adults now!

Due to a monumental effort from family, and good timing on our part we had furnished a reasonably large terrace with free sofas, bedroom furniture and kitchen equipment. Of course, being a tech-head and most importantly, male, I also brought a multitude of electronic gizmos that make a lot of noise and produce very pretty images.

Once settled, the garden became the focus. 2014 had a beautiful summer and our garden... well.

That wouldn't do.

For the sake of brevity I'll skip the transition period, but the result of it filled a large car four times over and two months of garden refuse bin collections.

It was a summer of home grown vegetables, long evenings sat by a small fire. Warmth, happiness and a feeling of accomplishment. University was done, work had begun full time and the future was optimistic.

### Sharp Intake
While this was going on my girlfriend had been searching for a job. She, unfortunately was not as luck-prone as me and her field of Psychology only made it more difficult.

I tried my best to help, to be supportive and to make sure we never got bogged down in it. The thing is though, that as months wear on so too does your resolve.

Having never been there, I can't say for definite but job hunting from the outside appeared almost like a cancer. It slowly grew until the normal bodily functions of happiness and optimism were drained away.

Time and time again she would be rejected. She comes from a traditional Irish family (traditional in the 'they're mad' sense) who have grafted through generations. The frustration of her being told no for jobs well below her capabilities for the bullshit of 'no experience' is not one that has faded over time. I'm still angry with one store owner who hung up immediately after rejection, explaining they don't give feedback to applicants. Bull. Shit. 

People may be applying because they want to get paid, but they're still *willing* to donate 8 hours of their day (and probably more if you asked). In winter, they would spend the few hours of daylight behind a store-front. In summer, they would watch tourists wander with ice-creams to the pub. So bullshit you don't give feedback, and bullshit you hang up on people like they're nothing to you. Not just for my partner, but for any applicant because the world is hard enough without people being assholes to you for trying.

Luckily, by the end of the summer she had gotten a job. Just as with the house, completely by chance in a place we did not expect. The giddy thrill of living alone on the hill however had taken an unrecoverable battering.

### Retreat from the World.
As winter finally broke through the warmth, and jumpers became compulsory attire again routine dealt the killer blow to any youthful optimism the year started with.

Friends succumbed to their own problems, some training to be teachers have had their ambitions in life tested to the limit. Others succeeded in getting relevant jobs for their careers, but at the price of long commutes and train fares eating what money they do earn.

Others continue to job hunt. 

As a couple, my partner and I developed into a more matured and more comfortable dynamic. We bought furniture together, we decorated our living spaces and explored new ways to get through the day where retail hours allow. At times it can be an alienating experience where the old student activities leave you tired, exhausted and confused. 

We have now became the old people at the party complaining the music is too loud and was *definitely* better in our day. Though for the sake of rigour, we do keep trying the young haunts with the necessary levels of alcohol.

### Can I breathe now?
2014 has been a year of such rapid advancements in both my job related education and my world knowledge. How relationships can be strained by working life, and how projects now become a compromise between personal development and enjoying the company of my friends.

The tone of this post may suggest a negative year. While yes, there has been a lot of stress and adjustment it has been a requirement to end up where I am. The breathing metaphor throughout reflects this.

You take the deep breath to prepare for the shock that is to come. As the months rolled on more shocks came, and more were *over*came. The shit has hit the fan multiple times on all levels of life and love and yet, here I am sitting in my living room enjoying a glass of wine in front of the fire. The things I'm not proud of are behind me, and through these experiences learning occurs.

The only thing that can happen from this point forward is the days get longer. The temperature begins to rise, and as the summer draws closer and closer there is so much that can be enjoyed for what it is. Not a giddy naive swoon with my own house on a hill, or an equally damaging depression over time lost and hard choices made.

Instead, let's just crack open a cold beer and sit on the patio I've worked so hard for. There are no more assignments. There are no more deadlines. There's just 60 years ahead now, and the first of those begins in 14 days.
