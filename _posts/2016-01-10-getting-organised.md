**It's January, and that means its time to work on some self-improvement. This isn't going to be the usual "I won't eat as much fatty foods" or "I'll go to the Gym" because everyone does (or more often gives up on) that.**

Instead, I'd like to take the opportunity in this first post of 2016 to identify the areas that I've struggled with over 2015 and what I'm planning to do to fix them. Let's start with the tastiest.

### Cooking Properly

I enjoy cooking, as a student my shopping lists very rarely consisted of the usual pasta, sauces and other "cheap" foodstuffs. That's not to say I went the opposite direction, buying pretentious ingredients and subjecting my fellow housemates to a culinary maelstrom. 

It was learning to cook with fresh, local ingredients that was my primary interest. Finding the local market was a delight, it seems no matter the volume of vegetables bought the total only ever comes to around Â£5. If there is one bit of advice I can give to current students, find the market, find the butchers - in a student centric city they can be orders of magnitude cheaper.

2015 saw a lot of this undone. Over the first two-thirds of the year my girlfriend took up a job as a visiting carer. The terrible treatment of some of the loveliest and hard working people I've ever met is for another post, but let's just say that 12 hour days and no weekends off the entire length of the position is just the tip of the iceberg.

The result of this, and my own full-time job meant that if I wanted to spend any time with her I needed to save precious minutes where I could. In addition to this, the long days spent walking, food needed to be quick. As a result, laziness takes hold. Not turkey-twizzler laziness, but slapdash curries with own brand sauces and bulk generic rice became the norm. The time since cooking even a simple lasagne could be measured in months.

It's a difficult habit to break, as other responsibilities don't just stop because you want to cook better. So a clean break was needed.

Over the holiday season I ran the stores down, the fridge was bare and meals were bought ad-hoc around the major events of Christmas and New Year. With those out of the way, it's time to start fresh!

I already had an extensive library of recipe books, it just required a little time spent working on a schedule - with the help of the [MealPlan app](http://www.falldaysoftware.com/mealplan). Ignore the iPad version which despite more screen space, seems use an awful interface to render it utterly wasted. The beauty of this app is that it will output a grocery list which means that once the recipes are entered and scheduled it becomes incredibly easy to go get all of the ingredients during the weekly shop.

This was important as buying from the local corner shop is expensive, and the 9-5 work hours means that market trips for on-the-day ingredients are difficult.

With the first night over, I am sitting here typing this very full, very satisfied and I am actually excited for tomorrows recipe to really get stuck in with some good honest home cooking. Going forward I may blog the recipes I have found particularly awesome.

Oh yes, blogging - that brings me to...

### Completing Jobs

At work, we use Wunderlist very effectively. Attempts to copy this productivity to the home however have not translated well. The 'Shared' list between my partner and I is the place for reminders to go to die. It's a productivity black-hole. Watching how much my parents managed to do in a week while raising me only makes the guilt build as the weeks go on.

Thinking about why this is lead me to a possible reason. At work, we have deadlines. Real ones. At home, a date on a reminder is just a date. If it's the choice between a spontaneous invitation to the cinema with friends then that date is less than meaningless. The final result is an overdue reminder which piles up on the other overdue reminders with no consequences.

Well, the consequences are a churn in household chores. I don't live in filth, but there is a build up before a big clean. Wouldn't it be nice to tackle it in smaller chunks? Instead, I'm attempting to move to a 'pool' model; instead of targetted timed tasks there is a weekly and month job pool. There is no order, priority or deadline *except* for the end of the week / month.

Yes, in theory you can leave everything to Sunday, but this isn't really the way. Instead there a gain to be had as you tick off jobs, the pool shrinks and the weekends get longer. The true benefit though is for those unplanned events - not vacuuming doesn't make you feel guilty if its put aside for a day. Just so long as it is *done*. It doesn't even matter who does it

The first step is to work out a **reasonable** list of jobs for the week. They can be as simple as check the bank balance, or as lengthy as wash the car. It doesn't matter so long as you can complete them within the week.

Next, work out some longer term jobs. Not everything needs to happen four times a month. Some examples of my monthly list are:

* Write a blog post on something
* Kitchen deep clean (as opposed to surfaces)
* Print and file payslips

These are not set in stone - we are still learning our way here. 

Once again, bringing out the app list my top choice for this is [Weekly](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/weekly-track-frequent-tasks/id880946246?mt=8). You can set how often a task should be done (EG, "I want to dance to lame songs 4 times a week"). Then, just tick them off. The week resets, and you do it again.

Unfortunately there is no app called "Monthly", so instead back to trusty Wunderlist and a repeating task.

### So far...
It can be difficult to balance work and home. Especially as a 20-something easily distracted by comfortable or shiny objects. Like most habit building, this isn't going to be an immediate change. But the first week has felt more achievable than whatever system I had in place in 2015.

I shall keep updating this with my progress, good or bad.
