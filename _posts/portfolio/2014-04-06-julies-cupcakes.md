Julie's Cupcakes was redesigned with several key objectives to improve on the 2012 build. Foremost, was a drastically improved design that incorporates a greater use of colour and additional decorative flourishes to be attractive to the core audience, as well as simplifying the content and navigation to further reinforce the friendly home-made feel of the website.

A second objective was to increase search engine rankings, this involved improved semantics and use of structured data where viable.

The end result is a fresh and vibrant website, with simple navigation and a good selection of content to really drive the products showcased.
