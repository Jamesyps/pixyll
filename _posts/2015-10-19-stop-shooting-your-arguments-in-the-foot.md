**There are certain articles I read and immediately dismiss as irrelevant to my interests, just plain bad or interesting and thought provoking. It's not often I find ones that are thought proving but through an intense veil of I-think-this-is-truly-awful.**

The article in question is *[Why Millennials Keep Dumping You: An Open Letter to Management](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-millennials-keep-dumping-you-open-letter-lisa-earle-mcleod)*. It raises some valid points about management styles and company culture, particularly noteworthy is that acting like the 'cool kids' of the business world, with the air hockey tables in the lobby and the free food is very different from actually adopting their ethos and productivity. As the author writes:

> Working in a cool office is really awesome. So is free lunch. But a purposeful culture is more important.

However, ripping out this one quote proved pretty difficult between the 'I' statements in nearly every sentence, or the universal buzz-words ripped straight from an Apple advertising campaign. 'Think Differently' has at this point become so densely ironic that its in danger of becoming a parody singularity.

This is where the article loses credibility. On the one hand it expresses a genuine desire to be respected and treated as a valued employee who isn't an Instagram-ming teenager just looking to get paid and move on. That with the right management, a company can look forward to a dedicated and hard-working employee who believes in the business. 

So why frame it through the angle of "I should be rewarded because I *actually* care". Let me cherry pick some quotes.

> We’re the ones who’ve mastered social media, who have the energy of a thousand suns, and who will knock back 5-dollar macchiatos until the job is done perfectly.

This first example sets up an Us vs You confrontation, implying that the 'millennial' worker is something to be sought after because *they are needed.* Why? Where is the justification beyond doing their job and being able to tweet? Do other workers not want the job done perfectly? Youthful enthusiasm and senior experience need to work together, not be contrasted. A large part of my bosses job is reigning in my more crazy, money-losing ideas and pointing me on the best track for the business - for all employees, not a wannabe 'rockstar'. 

> But I don’t wake up at 6AM every day to play foosball in the break room.

Waking up early is not a sacrifice, its a part of having a job. Whether you start at 11am and leave-off at 13:00, at some point work will clash with free-time. Comments like these are what open the floodgates to the misguided people who abuse and look down on the younger workforce. It is the undertones of wanting to be thanked for doing what is normal and expected that takes one of the better points in the article and chips away the weight of its argument.

> I was raised to believe I could change the world. I’m desperate for you to show me that the work we do here matters, even just a little bit.

The first part of this sentence is at odds with the second. If you believe you have the power to change the world, why do you need someone to tell you what you believe in? You should be doing what you do because you enjoy it and it fulfils a goal of your own. Finding a business that matches your own beliefs may be difficult, and not every job will be as fulfilling as the dream you are chasing but means-to-ends is a crucial part of life. Good management should nurture and respect these goals, but its up to you and you alone to fulfil them.

If the author's point is that a good manager will let you in on the bigger picture, rather than treat you like a robot who should complete tasks with no emotional rationale behind then that is a cause for merit, but should just be said explicitly.

> I’ll give you everything I’ve got, but I need to know it makes a difference to something bigger than your bottom line.

This is not as harmful as the other extracts, and it goes with the point above - it is very true that as an employee having an attachment to the business on a personal level is one of the better motivators than increases of money or responsibility. But ultimately, as above - why it is anyone's responsibility to make goals and fulfilment for you is a strange request.

I don't want to end this article as a mudslinging effort. Too many articles in the development world and beyond are simply tit-for-tat he's wrong / she's wrong / you're all wrong without saying what is good or taking better points from people's arguments.

In context, the focus of this post is an article written on LinkedIn to a clearly american audience. I am no expert but through reading online, work culture across the pond can be very different to the UK / Europe. Likewise, I have no experience in working for larger corporations. 

In this context the article's style may have been to gain larger attention than a typical 'good vs bad management' list. No doubt it worked - I was linked to it, and now I am writing about it.

I just take issue with the tone of expectation that is embedded within. As a young worker myself I hate to be included in the categorisation of people who thinking turning up for work every day is an achievement. Even more so, I hate the powerful figures who look down on my generation and think 'easy target'. 

Being the target of many of the austerity measures, with the paid opportunities shrinking and being priced out of the rental and buying housing markets the style of this article does nothing but justify their skewed reality that we really are entitled. The first and only time that word will appear in this post.

As we have seen with The Onion countless times, the crazies of the world will believe anything that aligns with their worldview - so let's not give them more ammunition to hit us with, hey?
