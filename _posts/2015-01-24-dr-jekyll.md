"I'll just have a play with Jekyll, since I've seen a couple of reddit posts about it lately."

It was only meant to be a couple of minutes investigating a tool I'd not used before, and two days later I've converted my old Ghost blog across and developed my own theme.

Looking back I can't really remember the part where I made this decision. Jekyll's siren call is just how fast it is in everything it does. Setting up a new GitHub repository, installing the gem and running `jekyll serve --watch` took no more than a few minutes.

Within five more I had found a great starter theme. Which within a few more minutes had turned into a full on sass frenzy putting my own stamp on it.

I pushed to GitHub and there my creation was given life. Four months of discarded illustrator work, two half-tried PHP builds and a cancelled Ghost subscription I had my own place to call home.

See, here's the beauty of it; to succesfully complete a new CMS driven website, or Ghost blog theme you need to both know their templating systems but also have everything ready to go. With time short and busy weekends your project begins to get pushed back until bit by bit it's no longer something you enjoy doing. This is something I've written about [before]({% post_url 2014-10-19-the-difficulties-of-managing-time %}).

Jekyll doesn't need this, so long as you've got your setup correct so it can actually generate the static assets it's ready to go. Updates are easy too, no more database-backups just a commit and a push.

Today for example, I've refined the work I did that first evening by optimising my CSS and JS to reach 99/100 on Google Page Speed. I've also added a header variant that changes depending on the time of day.

Right now I can leave it with a functioning site, and the next time I have a few minutes spare I can continue tweaking. I already have my eye on a few line-height issues on the mobile responsive states.

So if there is a conclusion to this post it will be this: if you're struggling to make what is supposed to be a small, lean site with limited time - Jekyll and GitHub pages are definately an option you should explore.
