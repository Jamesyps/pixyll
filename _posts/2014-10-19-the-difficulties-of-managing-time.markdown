summary: There was once a time, sitting in my student bedroom that I had plenty of time. Those days are now behind me, so can I do with the little time I have spare?

**There was once a time, sitting in my student bedroom that I had plenty of time. I could, if I had been so inclined, have dipped my toes into iOS development. Or alternatively, focused more on design theories and the latest trends. I could even have considered a gap in the market, and produced a minimum-viable product to fill it.**

Why these are all written as 'could haves' is the simple fact that back then I had no working life from which to bounce ideas off. I had no idea of the real-world problems people faced, and I certainly had no developer interaction on my course other than a few close friends who were equally lost in the void of too much time on their hands. 

That is not to say that we did not attempt any - *Quizzit*, a real-time quiz app for the academic space was the focus of myself and a few friends for a few months, but without a viable business model the energy dissapated.

These days it is a very different story, and one that has been often told. Working full time as a Web Developer in Lincoln, my time is split between fulfilling my role there, and making sure clients have the best possible website I can give them, and my home life of enjoying my home, girlfriend and social life.

During the working day, there are now ideas that I can incubate and iterate as I go about my daily tasks. How I can shave a few minutes from this repetitive task, how I can help my colleagues integrate a new tool into their workflow and of course how I can make the next site better than the last. It is an exellent arena for finding problems, and working on the solutions - especially when inbetween client builds there are the brief moments of free time to work on these solutions.

Examples of these solutions include *Base*, a SASS based micro-framework that enables myself and my colleagues to write consistent code, with helpful mixins that save time on common tasks - such as icon generation, colour management and code organisation. Or our Briefing Forms, a web app that allows clients to fill in their needs and requirements in a branded, fun and more useful way than PDF documents or plain web forms.

However, these snatched moments of problem solving are never enough. As Web Developers we are never satisfied with simply thinking of projects, we need to make them happen. This is where the constraint of time hits - do I work on my latest project? Or do I mow the lawn? Do I spend the limited time between work schedules with my girlfriend, or do I work on a design for the latest app I've had planned for months?

Invariably I will choose the social route, and snatch moments of development in my home office in times of quiet but this often leads to a stressed, frenzied approach knowing that if I don't get at least some of my work done today, it will be many weeks before I can come back to it. Frustration leading to resentment, and projects that wither as last month's knowledge is built upon during the day-job and the home-projects fall behind the new found education.

To not choose the social route would mean isolation - not to mention an unhappy girlfriend.

## A Solution

This post may appear to represent me as someone who is completely unable to manage my time. This is not true, I have spent most of my summer moving house, wrapping up university and enjoying the freedom of a 9-5 working day. The issues arise from the inexperience of living and working independently. University teaches you to manage a schedule, but ultimately so long as the work is complete it very rarely matters at what point you do it - an 8 hour library binge, or managed regular chunks.

It's not a lesson that can be taught, and though there are plenty of articles about managing projects, balancing home-life and being productive they are either very personal to the author or generic enough to catch search engine traffic.

To put into context this post, I scheduled today as the day I complete the HTML side of my new site design. By 3PM I had exhausted myself and felt the familiar fade as I lost concentration. I felt caught between knowing I had to finish *at least* one project before starting another and the frustration that overall, it didn't matter and wouldn't make me happy.

Instead, I decided to break the vacuum in which I work and allow my processes, frustrations and work to be exposed to the world. Inspired by other developer blogs, including [Eric Barnes' Rebuilding Wardrobe](http://ericlbarnes.com/rebuilding-wardrobe-week-3/) series I am hoping to start making regular posts of my ideas, and my execution. To build a record of my planning, failures, learning and successes that may just tip me beyond the point of staring at my code editor, watching the cursor blink and knowing that behind me the clock is ticking.
