> "Are you ok?"

An innocuous question asked across the boardroom table. There was no hint of threat in the question, a question that I have no doubt my boss already knew the answer to.

It’s not easy to think that you may have a mental condition. Not out of an aspect of pride, or denial but out of shame. By all accounts things are very positive, there is no crippling debt. My pay is fair and no doubt above the average for my age group and location. I have a long-term partner with whom I share a very deep and mutual connection with. There are so many people out there who are more justified in feeling down. What gives me the right to allow these feelings to form?

When asked the question I answered as honest as possible. That I didn't know if there was something wrong with me, but I wasn’t in a good place. For the previous three weeks I had worked to isolate myself, a hard task in a tight-knit studio of five people. Before that was a period of a few months of what could be considered ‘normal’ behaviour. Before that, another round of isolation - though perhaps hidden better.

The truth is that despite everything I don’t remember the last time I was happy. The past year has resulted in the various ‘up’ moments being less, and the ‘down’ moments being deeper. The cruelness of feeling nothing is that not even memories can penetrate it - what should appear as good times are viewed as though an autopsy is being performed. Picked apart with no feeling, only to be documented as an event that occurred at a point in time.

An even stranger fact is that this feeling of complete emptiness is not an unpleasant one. It’s not wallowing in self-pity, if anything I am a perfectly confident and capable individual. It allows for no distractions, even from close friends. It removes you from the world and allows in some cases for some intense inward reflection. It could even be considered at times as periods of meditation where unnecessary thoughts and emotions are removed leaving on contemplation. This of course is a sirens call into a darker world.

A beautiful post that describes this feel provides one of the best analogies I could find to describe this feeling:

> You don’t even notice it happening. Later, if you’re lucky enough to get the chance, that’s the part that terrifies you. Just another day, and another, and another. The room a little colder each morning. The night a deeper black. But what do you care? You’re just fine where you are, in its strangely warm embrace.

> Depression is a hot shower on a Winter morning, there amidst the steam and the clouded glass. A stiff drink on a grim night. It’s the blanket, not the breeze. That’s what’s so frightening.

> Because it feels wonderful. Sensory deprivation, when you need it most. It’s an off-switch from all that’s outside. And wherever you go, it stays with you.

It’s not clear to me why this year has tipped the balance from manageable to a slowly developing chaos. My best analysis would be that no sudden thing can cause such an inertial shift - that the weight of many years, many smaller events must have each added their individual pressure. That choices made many years ago are finally bearing their poisoned fruit.
Seeking validation in software development is one of the larger mistakes. This is not to be confused with having pride in your work but to craft your identity and anchor your mental state to a world of constantly needing to improve. A world that presents the carrot of happy clients, efficient code and the ability to reach thousands and millions of individuals and change their lives, even in a small way. The stick of course being chased by fears of being left behind. That your work is now obsolete and all those people are complete removed from you. There is no validation in this world because there are only problems to be solved. 

There will never be a day when sitting back and being able to say ‘done’ is possible. This is fine, normal and part of any career - but gambling your mental health on that (much like those with mortgages that follow interest rates, only to find their monthly payments skyrocket in economic disasters) is a costly mistake.

At the end of the brilliantly written Bojack Horseman episode ‘Bojack Kills’, the characters discuss finding happiness:

> …only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy.

I do not believe this to be a direct instruction, a ‘run off into the wilderness’ approach of removing material possessions and living life frugally. The character who said it remained wealthy, with large properties in keeping with the show’s Hollywood setting. It’s a metaphor for not being precious over retaining the parts that don’t work. Some things cannot be repaired, or coaxed into becoming the way you would like them to be. They are a flawed design from their very foundations and are simply too damaging to keep dragging behind you.

So no, giving up being a developer is not the aim. I enjoy it, but I should not be defined by it and be willing to give up that part of my identity.

Admitting this is difficult, even now it feels somehow cheap and dirty to publicly write about what externally appears to be ‘feeling a little down’. But to continue ignoring it is dangerous. It is dangerous to keep the comforting blanket of emptiness, it is dangerous to try and mould an intractable design into who I am. 

Moving forward the goal is to exist first, and figure out who I am in time. The world inside my mind should be made smaller, so each achievement and positive step forward is more meaningful.
