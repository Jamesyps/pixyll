Julie's Cupcakes was redesigned with several key objectives to improve on the 2012 build. Foremost, was a drastically improved design that incorporates a greater use of colour and additional decorative flourishes to be attractive to the core audience, as well as simplifying the content and navigation to further reinforce the friendly home-made feel of the website.
